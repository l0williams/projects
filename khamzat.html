Chechen Republic of Ichkeria,
where he started wrestling when he was five years old.
It has been reported he won a bronze medal
at the Russian National Championships in the junior level.
In 2013, when he was 18, he immigrated
to Sweden with his mother, joining his older brother
            
After moving to Sweden, Chimaev wrestled at multiple clubs,
Considered one of the best freestyle wrestlers in the country,
Chimaev won a gold medal at the 2016
and 2017 Swedish Freestyle National Championships at 86
kilograms, and in 2018 he did so at 92 kilograms.
Chimaev has had a series of dominant performances in the
tournament, posting an overall record of 12-0,
which includes three pins, seven technical falls and holds a
combined score of 105 points, while only
surrendering two himself, across all of his three 
showdowns. Chimaev has competed in a few judo tournaments
and in four combat sambo fights.
                    
Chimaev first started training in MMA when he was 23 years old.

along with three-time UFC Light Heavyweight Championship challenger
Alexander Gustafsson, Ilir Latifi and Reza Madadi among others.
                
Between September 2017 and April 2018, Chimaev had three amateur
MMA fights.
The first of them was against future IMMAF World Champion
Khaled Laallam, whom he defeated via submission in the second round.
He won his following two amateur fights, one by submission and
one by technical knockout, completing his amateur career with a record of 3-0.

                <h2>BRAVE FC CAREER</h2>
            After having his first two professional
            fights in Sweden,
            Chimaev signed with Middle Eastern
            organization
            Brave Combat Federation.
            He was scheduled to make his promotional
            debut against
            Benjamin Bennett on 16 November 2018,
            at Brave CF 18.However, Bennett withdrew
            from the bout
            and was replaced by undefeated prospect
            Marko Kisič.Chimaev won the fight

            Chimaev had a quick turnaround for his
            next fight when he took
            on Sidney Wheeler on short notice on
            22 December 2018,
            at Brave CF 20, replacing an injured
            Leon Aliu.He won the fight.

            He then fought Ikram Aliskerov on 19
            April 2019, at Brave CF 23.
            This was Chimaev's debut in the welterweight
            division. He won the bout via knockout after
            landing an uppercut
            in the first round.This performance earned
            him Brave's Knockout of the Night award.

            His fourth promotional fight came
            against Mzwandile Hlongwa
            on 4 October 2019, at Brave CF 27.

            first event in Chimaev's
            hometown of Stockholm, Sweden.
            However, the event would be postponed due
            to the COVID-19 pandemic
            and the matchup was cancelled altogether 
            when Chimaev signed with the UFC instead.

                <h2>UFC CAREER</h2>
            Chimaev made his promotional debut in a 
            middleweight bout against
            John Phillips, replacing Duško Todorović,
            on 16 July 2020, at UFC on ESPN 13.He won
            the fight via submission
            in the second round.This win earned him
            the Performance of the Night award.

            Ten days after the fight against Phillips,
            Chimaev faced promotional newcomer
            Rhys McKee at welterweight on 25 July 2020,
            at UFC on ESPN 14.He won the fight via
            technical knockout in the first round.

            It was reported on 6 September 2020, that 
            Chimaev would have another quick
            turnaround as he was booked to face
            Gerald Meerschaert
            on 19 September 2020, at UFC Fight Night 178.
            He won the fight against 
            Meerschaert via knockout just 17 seconds
            into round one.
            This win earned him his third straight
            Performance of the Night award.

            Chimaev was scheduled to face Leon Edwards
            in the main event of 
            UFC Fight Night 183 on 19 December 2020.
            In between, Chimaev was added to the UFC
            welterweight rankings, entering
            at 15.On 29 November, it was announced that 
            Chimaev had tested positive for COVID-19,
            and the bout was declared to be
            in jeopardy.On 1 December, Edwards
            also tested positive
            for COVID-19 and the bout was subsequently
            postponed.On 22 December, it was
            announced that the bout was rescheduled 
            for 20 January 2021,
            at UFC Fight Night 185. Subsequently,
            Chimaev pulled out of the contest on
            29 December due to his own COVID-19 recovery.
            As a result, the bout was momentarily cancelled.
            The pair was rescheduled 
            once again to headline UFC Fight Night 187,
            on 13 March. However, on 11 February,
            UFC president Dana White announced the fight was
            once again cancelled due to 
            Chimaev suffering from lingering effects of COVID-19.

            On 1 March 2021, he announced on Instagram
            that he was retiring from 
            the sport due to lung complications
            caused by COVID-19.
            Dana White later came out and said Chimaev
            was not retired and was just
            emotional after experiencing effects
            of prednisone for
            his lungs during a training session.

            Chimaev returned to face Li Jingliang on
            30 October 2021, at UFC 267.
            He won the bout via technical submission, choking
            Jingliang unconscious with a rear-naked choke
            in round one. 
            This win earned him his fourth
            straight Performance of the Night award.

            Chimaev faced Gilbert Burns at UFC 273
            on 9 April 2022. Chimaev won the
            fight via unanimous decision.
            The fight was awarded the 
            Fight of the Night award. The fight 
            also earned him first place in the
            Crypto.com Fan Bonus of the Night award.

            Chimaev was scheduled to face Nate Diaz
            on 10 September 2022 in the
            main event of UFC 279. At the weigh-ins,
            Chimaev weighed in at 178.5 pounds,
            seven and a half pounds over the
            welterweight non-title fight limit. 
            As a result of missing weight, Chimaev 
            was removed from his main event bout
            with Diaz, and instead faced Kevin Holland
            in the co-main event at
            a 180-pound catchweight bout. Holland was 
            already set for a 180-pound catchweight bout
            against Daniel Rodriguez on the card. 
            Chimaev won the bout via D'Arce Choke in the first round.
